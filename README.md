# Advent of Code 2020
My puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2020. Mainly solving puzzles in python, but may implement some in C++ as well.

## Build & Run
### Python
I excpect to use only the standard library, no additional installs required.
The scripts expect to be called from the command line like this:
```
./a.py in.txt
```


### C++
I probably won't use any external dependencies. I use C++17, so compiling from the command line should work
via:
```
g++ -std=c++17 a.cpp
```

My solutions expect input from `stdin`, so run them like this:
```
./a < input.txt
```
